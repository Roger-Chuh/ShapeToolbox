Some tools for rendering images of the 3D shapes are listed below.
Please note that |toolbox| does *not* include any rendering
capabilities.  It only produces the models.  The tools listed below
can be useful for rendering the shapes, but they are not part of
|toolbox|, and they are not the only ones available out there.
