Some tools for rendering images of the 3D shapes are listed below.
Please note that |toolbox| does *not* include any rendering
capabilities.  It only produces the models.  The tools listed below
can be useful for rendering the shapes, but they are not part of
|toolbox|, and they are not the only ones available out there.

Mitsuba
=======

Mitsuba is an open-source rendering program that is based on PBRT (physically-based rendering). This means that Mitsuba mimics the physical interaction between light and surfaces relatively accurately. Mitsuba has both a GUI and a command-line interface (although configuring the command line tools on Mac/Windows can be challenging). The advantage of Mitsuba in comparison to other physically accurate renderers, such as RADIANCE, is its ease of use especially for rendering newbies. 

See 'The Mitsuba project <http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/download.html>'_ for downloading instructions and packages for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Also see 'the documentation <http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/docs.html>'.
