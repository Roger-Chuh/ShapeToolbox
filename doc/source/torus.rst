Coordinate system
=================


The torus also has the option for the modulation of the major radius.
This happens as a function of the angle theta.

===========

Watch out for discontinuities when using oriented (non=cardinal)
modulations.  The gratings cannot be made to meet at both seams.  You
can use a modulator to hide the discontinuity at one of the seams.
