This Getting Started tutorial demonstrates the use of the function
:ref:`ref-objmakesphere` that produces model spheres with a modulated
radius (with the modulation consisting of sine wave components).
There are many other functions that make other types of object
(planes, cylinder, tori, or surfaces of revolution), but the logic for
defining the modulation is the same in them all.  There are also
functions for producing other types of perturbation (for example,
based on filtered noise components).  The use of all those functions
should be easy to learn after familiarizing yourself with the examples
in this tutorial.
