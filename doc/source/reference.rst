******************
Function reference
******************

This reference section contains the function-specific help.  At the
moment these are just the Matlab/Octave help strings from the
functions themselves, but they should be fairly complete.  These are
copied here from the functions themselves, so the help for, say,
`objMakeNoise` here is exactly the same as what you get by doing::

  help objMakeNoise

in the command window.  After the help string, additional examples and
clarifications are provided to some of the functions.
