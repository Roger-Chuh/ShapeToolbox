Making more complex shapes
**************************

TODO.

First, combine surface of revolution and extrusion profiles.

Demonstrate using the y-option with revolution to define more complex
surfaces of revolution.

Then, use spinex and spinez options with cylinders, surfaces of
revolution, and extrusions.  EMphasize it's only a translation of the
xz-midpoint of the shape.

Finally, demonstrate the use of the worm shape.  Explain the
difference to the one above.

And really finally, you can use the surface of revolution and
extrusion shapes together with the worm.  The "worm" is really a
"super-shape" that bends the cylinder-type shapes.
