Getting help
============

Best way to learn to create models with |toolbox| is to start with
some example code and build on that.  The models are quick to create
and view, and exploration and trial-and-error is a good way to get
started.

Details on the shapes and various kinds of perturbation can be found
in the command line help in Octave/Matlab and in this manual.


Command line help in Octave/Matlab
==================================

All the functions in |toolbox| have documentation that can be viewed
in the Octave/Matlab command window, for example::

  help objMakeSine


HTML-manual, local copy
=======================

When all else fails, read the manual.  A copy of this manual comes
with |toolbox| and can be found in ``ShapeToolbox/doc/build/html``.
The manual covers the shapes and perturbations with numerous
examples.  Texture mapping and rendering are also covered to some
extent.


HTML-manual, online
===================

The latest version of this HTML manual (for the latest version of the
toolbox) can be found in http://saarela.github.io/ShapeToolbox/.


Email
=====

The answer to most questions should really be in the help strings or
in the manual.  But if something is not working correctly, things
crash, etc., shoot an email to shapetoolbox@gmail.com.
