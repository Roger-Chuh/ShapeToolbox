TODO.

These tutorials demonstrate the creation of more complex shapes,
series of shapes, etc.  They try to cover the whole process from
creating the model to setting material and texture properties to
rendering the images.

To make the most of the tutorials and to understand what's going on,
you might want/need to look at the later sections on object types and
rendering.
