% Usage:          objMakeSine(SHAPE) 
%                 objMakeSine(SHAPE,CPAR,[OPTIONS])
%                 objMakeSine(SHAPE,CPAR,MPAR,[OPTIONS]) 
%         MODEL = objMakeSine(...)
%
% Produce a 3D model mesh object of a given shape, perturbed by
% sinusoidal modulation, and save it to a file in Wavefront
% obj-format.  Optionally return a structure that holds the model
% information.
%
% The base shape is defined by the first argument, SHAPE.  The
% parameters for the modulation are defined by CPAR, and the
% parameters for the optional envelope of the modulation are defined
% in MPAR.  See details below.
% 
% SHAPE:
% ======
%
% Either an existing model returned by one of the objMake*-functions,
% or a string defining a new shape.  If a string, has to be one of
% 'sphere', 'plane', 'disk','cylinder', 'torus', 'revolution',
% 'extrusion' or 'worm'.  See details in the help for objMakePlain.
% Example: 
%   objMakeSine('sphere')
%
% CPAR:
% =====
%
% Parameters for the modulation "carriers".  The parameters are the
% frequency, angle (orientation), phase, and amplitude:
%   CPAR = [FREQ ANGLE PH AMPL]
%
% The sinusoidal modulation is added to the base shape: to the radius
% for spheres, cylinder, surfaces of revolution, and extrusions; to
% the "tube" radius for tori; and to the z-component of planes and
% disks.
%
% Frequency is radial (in cycle/(2*pi)) for the sphere, cylinder,
% torus, surface of revolution, and extrusion shapes; and spatial
% frequency for the plane shape.  Phase and angle/orientation are
% given in degrees.  Modulations are in sine phase (phase 0 is sine
% phase).  Angle 0 is "vertical", parallel to the y-axis (z-axis
% for planes and disks).
%
% Several carriers are defined in rows of CPAR:
%   CPAR = [FREQ1 ANGLE1 PH1 AMPL1 
%           FREQ2 ANGLE2 PH2 AMPL2 
%           ... 
%           FREQN ANGLEN PHN AMPLN]
%
% MPAR:
% =====
%
% Parameters for the modulation "envelopes".  The envelope modulates
% the amplitude of the carrier.  The format of the parameter vector is
% the same as as CPAR.  Envelope contrast 0 means no modulation of
% carrier amplitude, contrast 1 means the amplitude varies between 0
% and the carrier amplitude set in CPAR.  If several envelopes are
% defined, they are multiplied.
%
% To pair carriers with envelopes (for example, to alternate between
% two carriers), additional group indices can be defined.  Carriers
% with the same index are added together, and the amplitude of the
% compound is multiplied with the corresponding envelope.  The group
% index is the (optional) fifth entry of the parameter vector:
%   CPAR = [FREQ1 ANGLE1 PH1 AMPL1 GROUP1
%           ...
%           FREQN ANGLEN PHN AMPLN GROUPN]
% 
%   MPAR = [FREQ1 ANGLE1 PH1 AMPL1 GROUP1
%           ...
%           FREQM ANGLEM PHM AMPLM GROUPM]
% 
% Group index is a non-negative integer.  Group index 0 (the default
% group index) is special: All carriers with index zero are added to
% the other components WITHOUT first being multiplied with a
% modulator.  Modulators with group index 0 multiply the sum of ALL
% components, including components already multiplied by their own
% modulators.  Gets confusing, right?  See examples below and in the
% online help.
%
% OPTIONS:
% ========
%
% All the same options as in objMakePlain.  See objMakePlain
% documentation: 
%   help objMakePlain;
% 
% AXIS 
% When the model shape is sphere, you can 'tilt' the model coordinate
% system before adding the sinusoid. The option 'axis' can be used
% to give the axis with respect to which the model is tilted. The
% axis is given as a three-element vector. The tilt magnitude is
% given using the option 'angle' (below).
%
% ANGLE
% The angle by which the model is tilted before adding the sinusoid
% (see the description of the option 'axis' above).
% Example:
% > m = objMakeSine('sphere',...,'axis',[1 0 0],'angle',45);
%
% RETURNS:
% ========
%
% A structure holding all the information about the model.  This
% structure can be given as input to another objMake*-function to
% perturb the shape, or it can be given as input to objSave to save it
% to file (although, unless the option 'save' is set to false when
% calling an objMake*-function, it is not necessary to save the model
% manually).
